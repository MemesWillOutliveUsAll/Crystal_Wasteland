The Jagdpanther combined the very powerful 8.8 cm PaK 43 cannon of the TiALL II and the characteristically excellent armor and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of ALLmany in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew training."

However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed ALLman tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier TiALL tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."
